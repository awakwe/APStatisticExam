#### Solutions
a. Finding the Area to the Right of χ² = 1.41 under the Chi-Square Curve with 2 Degrees of Freedom using a TI-83 Calculator

In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to find the area to the right of χ² = 1.41 under the chi-square curve with 2 degrees of freedom using a TI-83 calculator.

 Step 1: Turn on the TI-83 calculator

Turn on your TI-83 calculator by pressing the `ON` button located at the bottom left corner of the device.

 Step 2: Access the chi-square distribution function

To access the chi-square distribution function on the TI-83 calculator, follow these steps:

1. Press the `2ND` button (located in the top left corner of the calculator).
2. Press the `VARS` button (located above the `7` key) to access the distribution menu.
3. Use the down arrow key to navigate to the `χ²cdf(` function (usually option 7).
4. Press the `ENTER` button to select the function.

 Step 3: Input the parameters

After selecting the `χ²cdf(` function, you will see the following on the screen:

`χ²cdf(`

Now, input the parameters:

1. Enter the lower bound: Since we want to find the area to the right of χ² = 1.41, our lower bound will be 1.41. Input `1.41,` after the opening parenthesis.
2. Enter the upper bound: As we want to find the area to the right, we should input a large value as the upper bound. A common practice is to use 1E99 (1 * 10^99) as the upper bound. Input `1E99,` after the comma.
3. Enter the degrees of freedom: As given, there are 2 degrees of freedom. Input `2` after the last comma.
4. Close the parenthesis by inputting `)`.

Your screen should now display:

`χ²cdf(1.41,1E99,2)`

 Step 4: Calculate the result

Press the `ENTER` button to calculate the result. The calculator will display the area to the right of χ² = 1.41 under the chi-square curve with 2 degrees of freedom.

2. Press the `VARS` button (located above the `7` key) to access the distribution menu.
3. Use the down arrow key to navigate to the `χ²cdf(` function (usually option 7).
4. Press the `ENTER` button to select the function.

 Step 3: Input the parameters

After selecting the `χ²cdf(` function, you will see the following on the screen:

`χ²cdf(`

Now, input the parameters:

1. Enter the lower bound: Since we want to find the area to the right of χ² = 19.62, our lower bound will be 19.62. Input `19.62,` after the opening parenthesis.
2. Enter the upper bound: As we want to find the area to the right, we should input a large value as the upper bound. A common practice is to use 1E99 (1 * 10^99) as the upper bound. Input `1E99,` after the comma.
3. Enter the degrees of freedom: As given, there are 9 degrees of freedom. Input `9` after the last comma.
4. Close the parenthesis by inputting `)`.

Your screen should now display:

`χ²cdf(19.62,1E99,9)`

 Step 4: Calculate the result

Press the `ENTER` button to calculate the result. The calculator will display the area to the right of χ² = 19.62 under the chi-square curve with 9 degrees of freedom.

For example:

`0.01973`

So, the area to the right of χ² = 19.62 under the chi-square curve with 9 degrees of freedom is approximately 0.01973.

#### Marital status
Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test for Marital Status Distribution
===============================================================

We want to determine if the marital status distribution of the U.S. males aged 25 to 29 years old is evenly distributed.

a. State the null and alternative hypotheses
--------------------------------------------

Let's state the null and alternative hypotheses for a chi-square goodness of fit test:

H0 (Null Hypothesis): The marital status distribution of the U.S. males aged 25 to 29 years old is evenly distributed.

HA (Alternative Hypothesis): The marital status distribution of the U.S. males aged 25 to 29 years old is not evenly distributed.

b. Calculate the expected counts
--------------------------------

Given that H0 assumes an even distribution, the expected counts for each marital status are:

Never Married: 125 (500 \* 0.25) Married: 125 (500 \* 0.25) Widowed: 125 (500 \* 0.25) Divorced: 125 (500 \* 0.25)

c. Find the Statistic X2 and degrees of freedom
-----------------------------------------------

To calculate the chi-square statistic (X2), we need to find the difference between observed and expected counts, square it, and then divide it by the expected counts. The formula for X2 is:

X2 = Σ ( (O - E)^2 / E )

O: Observed counts E: Expected counts

X2 = ( (260 - 125)^2 / 125 ) + ( (220 - 125)^2 / 125 ) + ( (0 - 125)^2 / 125 ) + ( (20 - 125)^2 / 125 ) X2 ≈ 98.48

The degrees of freedom (df) for this test are:

df = (Number of categories - 1) df = (4 - 1) = 3

d. Find the P-value and state your conclusions
----------------------------------------------

To find the P-value using a TI-83 calculator, follow these steps:

1. Press the 2ND key and then press the VARS key.
2. Select option 7: χ²cdf(.
3. Enter the values: 98.48, ∞, 3) and press ENTER.

The calculator will display the P-value, which is close to 0.

Since the P-value is close to 0 and much smaller than the significance level (α = 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis (H0).

**Conclusion**: There is evidence to suggest that the marital status distribution of the U.S. males aged 25 to 29 years old is not evenly distributed.


#### Extra Activ % Grade
Hypothesis Testing for the Relationship Between Extracurricular Activities and Course Grades

 Background

North Carolina State University conducted a study to examine the relationship between time spent in extracurricular activities and whether a student earned a C or better in a required chemical engineering course. The data for 119 students who answered a question about extracurricular activities are shown below:

|               | <2 hours | 2 to 12 hours | >12 hours |
|---------------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| C or better   | 11       | 68            | 3         |
| D or F        | 9        | 23            | 5         |

 Hypothesis

H0 (null hypothesis): There is no relationship between time spent in extracurricular activities and course grades, i.e., the variables are independent.

H1 (alternative hypothesis): There is a relationship between time spent in extracurricular activities and course grades, i.e., the variables are dependent.

 Steps to Test Hypothesis Using TI-83 Calculator

1. Calculate row and column totals, and fill them in a table:

|               | <2 hours | 2 to 12 hours | >12 hours | Total |
|---------------|----------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| C or better   | 11       | 68            | 3         | 82    |
| D or F        | 9        | 23            | 5         | 37    |
| Total         | 20       | 91            | 8         | 119   |

2. Calculate the expected values for each cell using the formula: `(row total * column total) / grand total`

Expected values table:

|               | <2 hours | 2 to 12 hours | >12 hours |
|---------------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| C or better   | 13.79    | 63.04         | 5.17      |
| D or F        | 6.21     | 27.96         | 2.83      |

3. Calculate the chi-square test statistic (χ2) using the formula: `χ2 = Σ((observed - expected)^2 / expected)`

χ2 = 6.815 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

4. Find the p-value corresponding to the chi-square test statistic using the TI-83 calculator:

a. Press [2nd] > [VARS] to access the DISTR menu.
b. Scroll down to select the "χ2-cdf(" option.
c. Enter the test statistic, degrees of freedom (df = (rows - 1) * (columns - 1) = 1 * 2 = 2), and a large value for the upper bound (e.g., 1E99): `χ2-cdf(6.815, 2, 1E99)`.
d. Press [ENTER] to calculate the p-value.

p-value ≈ 0.033 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

5. Interpret the results:

- Compare the p-value to your chosen significance level (α, usually 0.05).
- If the p-value is less than α (0.033 < 0.05), reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that there is a relationship between time spent in extracurricular activities and course grades.


#### Smoking
 Hypothesis Testing for the Relationship Between Students' Smoking Habits and Their Parents' Smoking Habits

 Background

A survey was conducted among students in 8 Arizona high schools to examine the relationship between students' smoking habits and their parents' smoking habits. The data collected are shown below:

|                     | Student smokes | Student does not smoke |
|---------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Both parents smoke  | 400            | 1380                   |
| One parent smokes   | 416            | 1823                   |
| Neither parent smokes | 188          | 1168                   |

Hypothesis

H0 (null hypothesis): There is no relationship between students' smoking habits and their parents' smoking habits, i.e., the variables are independent.

H1 (alternative hypothesis): There is a relationship between students' smoking habits and their parents' smoking habits, i.e., the variables are dependent.

 Steps to Test Hypothesis Using TI-83 Calculator

1. Calculate row and column totals, and fill them in a table:

|                     | Student smokes | Student does not smoke | Total |

d. Press [ENTER] to calculate the p-value.

p-value ≈ 0 (rounded to 3 decimal places)

5. Interpret the results:

- Compare the p-value to your chosen significance level (α, usually 0.05).
- the p-value is less than α (0 < 0.05), reject the null hypothesis (H0) and conclude that there is a relationship between students' smoking habits and their parents' smoking habits.


#### Inference for Regression

1. Simple linear regression
   a. Least squares regression line
   b. Coefficient of determination (R-squared)
   c. Correlation coefficient (Pearson's r)
2. Inference for the slope of the population regression line
   a. Confidence intervals
   b. Hypothesis testing
3. Residual analysis and assumptions of regression
   a. Linearity
   b. Independence
   c. Normality of residuals
   d. Equal variance of residuals (homoscedasticity)
