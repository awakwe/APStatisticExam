## Quizzes

Throughout the module, there will be quizzes to test your knowledge on the topics we have covered. These quizzes will help you evaluate your understanding and identify areas where you may need to review.

## Active Learning Strategies

During the virtual lecture, we will use active learning strategies to engage with the material and deepen our understanding. These strategies may include group discussions, problem-solving activities, and interactive simulations.

## Conclusion

By the end of this module, you should have a strong foundation in AP Statistics and be well-prepared for the AP Statistics exam.
