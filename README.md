## Topics and Concepts Tested in the Exam

### Exploratory Analysis

1. Describing patterns and departures from patterns
2. Summarizing and representing distributions of univariate data
3. Comparing distributions of univariate data
4. Exploring bivariate data
5. Exploring categorical data



#### Describing Patterns and Departures from Patterns

1. Center: mean, median, and mode
2. Spread: range, interquartile range (IQR), variance, and standard deviation
3. Shape: symmetric, skewed, unimodal, bimodal, and uniform
4. Outliers: identification and potential causes
5. Transformations: logarithmic, square root, and other common transformations

#### Summarizing and Representing Distributions of Univariate Data

1. Dot plots
2. Histograms
3. Box plots
4. Stem-and-leaf plots
5. Cumulative frequency plots (ogives)

#### Comparing Distributions of Univariate Data

1. Measures of central tendency
2. Measures of dispersion
3. Shape comparison
4. Outliers and unusual features
5. Contextual interpretations

#### Exploring Bivariate Data

1. Scatterplots
2. Correlation coefficient (Pearson's r)
3. Least-squares regression line
4. Residuals and residual plots
5. Coefficient of determination (R-squared)

#### Exploring Categorical Data

1. Frequency tables
2. Bar charts
3. Pie charts
4. Segmented bar charts
5. Contingency tables and associated measures (relative frequency, joint frequency, and conditional frequency)


### Collecting Data

1. Planning and conducting surveys
2. Planning and conducting experiments
3. Generalizability of results from observational studies, surveys, and experiments

### Probability

1. Probability rules and concepts
2. Discrete and continuous random variables
3. Probability distributions, including binomial and normal distributions
4. Combining independent random variables
5. Sampling distributions

### Statistical Inference

1. Estimation (confidence intervals)
2. Hypothesis testing (significance tests)
3. Comparing two populations or treatments
4. Chi-square tests for categorical data
5. Inference for regression


## Quizzes

Throughout the module, there will be quizzes to test your knowledge on the topics we have covered. These quizzes will help you evaluate your understanding and identify areas where you may need to review.

## Active Learning Strategies

During the virtual lecture, we will use active learning strategies to engage with the material and deepen our understanding. These strategies may include group discussions, problem-solving activities, and interactive simulations.

## Conclusion

By the end of this module, you should have a strong foundation in AP Statistics and be well-prepared for the AP Statistics exam.
